        <p id="html"> What is HTML?
            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page
            HTML consists of a series of elements
            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

            <h2>Css</h2>
            <p id="css"> Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements on the page that you want to style. Selectors can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, or even their relationship with other elements.

                Properties and Values: Once you select an element, you can apply styles to it using properties and values. Properties are aspects of the element you want to change (like color, font-size, margin), and values specify how you want to change those properties (like specific colors, sizes, etc.).
                
                Cascade and Specificity: The "C" in CSS stands for Cascading, which refers to how styles are applied in a hierarchy. Styles can cascade from parent elements to child elements unless overridden. Specificity determines which styles are applied when conflicting styles are present.
                
                Units: CSS supports various units for specifying sizes, such as pixels (px), percentages (%), em, rem, and more. These units help make designs responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
                
                Box Model: Every element in CSS is considered a rectangular box. The box model describes how these boxes are structured, including properties like padding, border, margin, and content width and height.
                
                Layout Techniques: CSS provides mechanisms for creating different layout structures, including floats, flexbox, and grid layout. These techniques allow you to control the placement and alignment of elements on a webpage.
                
                Media Queries: With media queries, you can apply different styles based on characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width, orientation, or resolution. This is crucial for creating responsive designs.</p>

                <h2> Js</h2>
                <p id="js">JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. Here are some key aspects about JavaScript:

                    Purpose: JavaScript is primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to manipulate elements on a webpage, respond to user actions (like clicks and keystrokes), and modify content in real-time.
                    
                    Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is executed on the client-side (in the user's web browser), making it ideal for tasks that don't require server interaction. It enhances user experience by enabling interactive features without requiring page reloads.
                    
                    Syntax and Structure: JavaScript syntax is similar to C-style languages, making it relatively easy to learn for those familiar with languages like C++, Java, or C#. It supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms.
                    
                    Data Types and Variables: JavaScript supports various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime.
                    
                    Functions: Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. They play a crucial role in organizing code, promoting reusability, and enabling modular programming.
                    
                    DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of HTML and XML documents. JavaScript allows developers to manipulate the DOM, enabling dynamic updates to content and styles based on user interactions.
                    
                    Events: JavaScript can respond to various events triggered by user actions (e.g., clicks, keystrokes, mouse movements) or by the browser itself (e.g., page load, form submission). Event handling in JavaScript allows developers to create responsive and inte </p>
