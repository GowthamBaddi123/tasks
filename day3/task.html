            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These machines can be programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

        <pre>
            Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where a computer follows explicit instructions, machine learning allows systems to improve their performance on a task over time by identifying patterns and insights from data.

<h2>Types of Machine Learning:</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank"><h3>1.Supervised Learning:</h3></a>

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The model makes predictions based on this input-output relationship.
Examples:
Classification: Assigning categories to data (e.g., spam detection in emails).
Regression: Predicting numerical values (e.g., predicting house prices).

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning" target="_blank"><h3>2.Unsupervised Learning:</h3></a>

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without labeled responses and must find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
Examples:
Clustering: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity (e.g., customer segmentation).
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of random variables under consideration (e.g., principal component analysis).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank"><h3>3.Reinforcement Learning:</h3></a>

In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by performing certain actions and receiving rewards or penalties. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward.
Examples:
Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo).
Robotics (e.g., robots learning to navigate environments).
<h2>Key Concepts in Machine Learning:</h2>

<h3>1.Model:</h3>
A mathematical representation of a real-world process. It is trained on data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

<h3>2.Training:</h3>
The process of feeding data to a machine learning algorithm to learn the parameters of the model.

<h3>3.Testing:</h3>
Evaluating the performance of the trained model using a separate dataset to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

<h3>4.Features:</h3>
Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data being used in the model.

<h3>5.Labels:</h3>
The outputs or target values that the model aims to predict (used in supervised learning).

<h3>6.Overfitting:</h3>
When a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.

<h3>7.Underfitting:</h3>
When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and new data.

<h2>Common Algorithms:</h2>

<h3>1.Linear Regression:</h3>
A regression algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

<h3>2.Logistic Regression:</h3>
A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

<h3>3.Decision Trees:</h3>
A non-parametric supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features.

<h3>4.Support Vector Machines (SVM):</h3>
A classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

<h3>5.Neural Networks:</h3>
A set of algorithms modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. They are particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.

<h3>6.k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):</h3>
A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression, where the output is based on the k-nearest data points in the feature space.

<h3>7.Random Forest:</h3>
An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification or mean prediction for regression.
